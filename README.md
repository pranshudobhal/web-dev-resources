# Web Development Resources

We, as developers, often struggle to find the right resources for our projects and spend a lot of time researching.

This repository aims to solve that by making finding resources embarrassingly easy.

Please read [`contributing guidelines`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting new resources.
